# Astro Conversion Notes

## Completed
1. ✅ Created `astro.config.mjs` with React and Tailwind integrations
2. ✅ Updated `package.json` with Astro dependencies
3. ✅ Created Astro pages:
   - `src/pages/index.astro` (homepage)
   - `src/pages/about.astro`
   - `src/pages/services.astro`
   - `src/pages/projects.astro`
   - `src/pages/contact.astro`
   - `src/pages/project/[slug].astro` (dynamic route)
   - `src/pages/service/[slug].astro` (dynamic route)
4. ✅ Updated components to accept props instead of using `useParams`:
   - `src/pages/project/sections/Hero/index.tsx`
   - `src/pages/project/sections/Hero/components/MainImage.tsx`
   - `src/pages/project/sections/Hero/components/ThumbnailGrid.tsx`
   - `src/pages/project/sections/Hero/components/ImageGallery.tsx`
   - `src/pages/service/sections/Hero/index.tsx`
   - `src/pages/service/sections/Hero/components/HeroContent.tsx`

## Remaining Tasks

### 1. Replace React Router Links
All `Link` components from `react-router-dom` need to be replaced with regular anchor tags (`<a>`). Files that need updating:
- `src/components/Logo.tsx`
- `src/sections/Navbar/components/NavActions.tsx`
- `src/sections/Navbar/components/DesktopNav.tsx`
- `src/sections/Hero/components/HeroText.tsx`
- `src/sections/Hero/components/HeroButton.tsx`
- `src/sections/ServicesSection/index.tsx`
- `src/sections/ProjectsSection/components/ProjectCard.tsx`
- And ~60 other files (see grep results)

### 2. Remove ScrollToTop Component
The `ScrollToTop` component uses React Router's `useLocation`. Since Astro uses file-based routing, this can be removed or replaced with a simple script in the layout.

### 3. Update Components with Client Directives
Components that need interactivity should have client directives:
- `client:load` - for components that need to be interactive immediately
- `client:idle` - for components that can wait until the page is idle
- `client:visible` - for components that only need to be interactive when visible

### 4. Create Base Layout
Consider creating a base layout component (`src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro`) to avoid repeating the HTML structure in each page.

### 5. Remove Old Files
After conversion is complete, remove:
- `src/App.tsx` (no longer needed)
- `src/index.tsx` (no longer needed)
- Old React page components in `src/pages/home/`, `src/pages/about/`, etc. (keep sections)

### 6. Update Imports
Some components may need import path updates. The `@/` alias should still work with the Astro config.

### 7. Test Dynamic Routes
Test that dynamic routes work correctly:
- `/project/[slug]` should work for project detail pages
- `/service/[slug]` should work for service detail pages

### 8. Install Dependencies
Run: `npm install` to install Astro and new dependencies

### 9. Update Build Scripts
The build process is now handled by Astro. The `dist/` folder will be generated by `astro build`.

## Next Steps
1. Replace all `Link` components with anchor tags
2. Create a base layout
3. Test the application
4. Remove unused files
5. Update any remaining React Router dependencies
